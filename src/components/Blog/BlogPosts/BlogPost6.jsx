    <h1>Combating Quiet Quitting: Strategic Solutions for a Re-Engaged Workforce</h1>
    <p>
      Quiet quitting is a silent challenge facing modern organizations. Employees disengage emotionally and mentally, performing the bare minimum without openly resigning. Companies must address root causes—poor communication, lack of recognition, unclear growth paths, and burnout—to prevent this.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Strategies:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Open Communication:</strong> Foster a transparent environment where feedback is welcomed and acted upon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recognition & Appreciation:</strong> Reward both big and small achievements regularly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Growth Opportunities:</strong> Provide upskilling, mentorship, and clear career paths.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> Encourage healthy boundaries and offer flexibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pulse Surveys:</strong> Regularly measure engagement and act on findings.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By investing in these strategies, organizations can re-engage their workforce, reduce attrition, and foster loyalty.
